# Unsaid

This isn’t a project.
It’s a pause.

Some things don’t need explanations.
They just exist — quietly.

---

## What lives here

A few thoughts  
Some poems  
Small moments  
Unspoken feelings  

Nothing is rushed.
Nothing is forced.

---

## A gentle note

Not everything is meant to be read all at once.
Some pages are meant to be felt,
then left alone.

---

## Why this exists

Because some feelings stay.
Even when nothing else does.

---

## If you’re here

Take your time.
Scroll slowly.
Leave with calm.

That’s enough.
